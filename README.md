Mongo Helper
===========
This is a simple wrapper created to make it easier for us to prototype systems quickly with minimal errors.

NOTE: Don't use this if you don't already know how to interact with MongoDB.  Using Mongo Helper is no excuse for not understanding the underlying code.

Installing
=========
You can either install it by adding the following dependency in `package.json`:

    "dependencies": {
      "mongoHelper": "*" //Using * for versioning isn't recommended.  I'll fix that in the future.
    }
    
and then running `npm install` or by running `npm install mongoHelper`.
